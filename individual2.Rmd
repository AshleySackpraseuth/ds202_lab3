    Democrats tend to have less years of education than republicans, independents, and members of other parties.

    Individuals who never married tend to be happy. `r dat %>% filter(happy %in% c("Pretty happy", "Very happy") & marital == "Never married") %>% nrow` out of `r dat %>% filter(!happy %in% c("Not applicable", "Don't know", "No answer") & marital == "Never married") %>% nrow` (`r round((dat %>% filter(happy %in% c("Pretty happy", "Very happy") & marital == "Never married") %>% nrow) / (dat %>% filter(!happy %in% c("Not applicable", "Don't know", "No answer") & marital == "Never married") %>% nrow) * 100, digits=2)`%) of these individuals indicated that they were pretty happy or very happy. Married individuals tend to be happy. `r dat %>% filter(happy %in% c("Pretty happy", "Very happy") & marital == "Married") %>% nrow` out of `r dat %>% filter(marital == "Married") %>% nrow` of these individuals indicated that they were pretty happy or very happy. Separated individuals tend to be mostly pretty happy followed by not too happy. Divorced individuals tend to be pretty happy. Widowed individuals tend to be pretty happy.

    ```{r, dependson = "load", echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(dat %>% filter(!happy %in% c("Not applicable", "Don't know", "No answer") & marital != "No answer" & !party %in% c("No answer", "Don't know")), aes(happy)) + geom_bar() + facet_grid(marital~party, scales = "free_y") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25, hjust = 1)) + ggtitle("General Happiness of Political Party Affiliation vs. Marital Status") + ylab("Count") + xlab("General Happiness")
    dat %>%
      filter(!happy %in% c("Not applicable", "Don't know", "No answer") & marital != "No answer" & !party %in% c("No answer", "Don't know")) %>%
      group_by(marital, party) %>%
      summarize(perc_happy = sum(happy %in% c("Pretty happy", "Very happy")) / length(happy))
    ```

    Married individuals who were strong republicans reported being mostly very happy followed by pretty happy whereas every other political association for married individuals had mostly pretty happy reports. The other martial statuses and political affiliations showed no changes in distributions.

    ```{r, dependson = "load", echo = FALSE}
    dat %>%
      group_by(marital) %>%
      summarize(mean_educ = mean(educ, na.rm=TRUE))
    ```
    
    ```{r, dependson = "load", echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(dat %>% filter(!is.na(educ) & marital != "No answer"), aes(educ)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1) + facet_wrap(~marital, scales = "free_y") + ggtitle("Highest Year of School Completed vs. Marital Status") + ylab("Count") + xlab("Number of years completed in school")
    ```

    The histograms above appear to show that regardless of marital status, the distribution of number of years completed in school is relatively the same. Widowed and separated have the widest range of number of years completed in school. Based on the table, those who chose not to answer completed the highest years of education with an average of 15.5 years, followed by never married, divorced, married, separated, then widowed.
